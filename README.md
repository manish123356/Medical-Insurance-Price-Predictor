# 🏥 Medical Insurance Price Predictor - Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Overview

The **Medical Insurance Price Predictor** is a machine learning project developed using Python that aims to estimate individual insurance costs based on various personal and demographic features. This model can help insurance companies, healthcare providers, and individuals to better understand how specific factors impact medical insurance charges and make more informed decisions.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction. It also serves as an excellent example of using regression techniques to solve real-world problems with practical applications in the healthcare and insurance industries.

## 💡 Problem Statement

Medical insurance costs can vary significantly depending on personal attributes such as age, sex, BMI (Body Mass Index), number of children, smoking habits, and region. Accurately predicting these costs can:

- Help insurance providers set fair and accurate premiums
- Assist individuals in estimating future medical expenses
- Identify key factors affecting insurance costs

---

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **Medical Cost Personal Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains the following features:

- `age`: Age of the policyholder
- `sex`: Gender of the policyholder (`male` or `female`)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `children`: Number of children/dependents
- `smoker`: Smoking status (`yes` or `no`)
- `region`: Residential region in the US (`northeast`, `southeast`, `southwest`, `northwest`)
- `charges`: Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development and experimentation

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Exploration**
   - Load the dataset
   - Understand data distribution and feature types
   - Visualize relationships using plots (pairplot, heatmaps, histograms)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
   - Normalize/scale features if needed
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets

3. **Model Building**
   - Use regression algorithms such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Train models on the training set

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate performance using metrics:
     - R² Score
     - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Compare performance across different models

5. **Prediction**
   - Predict insurance charges for new input data
   - Create a sample user interface (CLI or Jupyter input form)

## 📈 Results

- Achieved a strong predictive performance with [insert R² score here].
- Identified `smoker` and `BMI` as key influential features.
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models performed better than basic linear regression.
- Visualized prediction accuracy and feature importance for better interpretation.
